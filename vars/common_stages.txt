   The common stages file contains helpers/methods that are to be used as stages across all pipelines.
   You can leverage the helpers/methods as such:
</p>
<p></p>
<pre>stage ('Preflight') {
   common_stages.startSlack()
   common_stages.preflight()
}</pre>
<p>
   The following is a general list of helpers/methods that are available.

<dl class="slack-vars">
   <dt>preflight()</dt>
   <dd style="margin: 0 0 1em 0">This method, which should be wrapped with a <code>stage</code> block, sets the job properties.
As of this writing, the two job properties it is setting is defining the amount of builds/artifacts to keep (10) and disabling
concurrency. The method does not take any inputs.</dd>
   <dt>actSA(gKey, gInstance)</dt>
   <dd style="margin: 0 0 1em 0">This method, which should be wrapped with a <code>stage</code> block, activates a GCP service
account using credentials stored in Jenkins. <code>gKey</code> is the credentials ID for the service account key file and
<code>gInstance</code> is the GCP project to target. The method is wrapped in a try/catch and uses the <code>common_helpers.catchMe()</code>
helper if activation fails.</dd>
   <dt>startSlack()</dt>
   <dd style="margin: 0 0 1em 0">This method, which should be wrapped with a <code>stage</code> block, notifies via Slack that the
job has started. As of this writing, this method calls <code>common_helpers.notifySlackStart()</code> in the common_helpers file.
The method does not take any inputs.</dd>
   <dt>startDiscord()</dt>
   <dd style="margin: 0 0 1em 0">This method, which should be wrapped with a <code>stage</code> block, notifies via Discord that the
job has started. As of this writing, this method calls <code>common_helpers.notifyDiscordStart()</code> in the common_helpers file.
The method does not take any inputs.</dd>
   <dt>notifyEmail()</dt>
   <dd style="margin: 0 0 1em 0">This method, which should be wrapped with a <code>stage</code> block, notifies via email that the
job has ended. This method is usually accompanied with <code>notifySlack()</code> in the same stage (usually the last stage).
As of this writing, this method calls <code>common_helpers.notifyEmailSuccess()</code> in the common_helpers file. The method
does not take any inputs.</dd>
   <dt>notifySlack()</dt>
   <dd style="margin: 0 0 1em 0">This method, which should be wrapped with a <code>stage</code> block, notifies via Slack that the
job has ended. This method is usually accompanied with <code>notifyEmail()</code> in the same stage (usually the last stage).
As of this writing, this method calls <code>common_helpers.notifySlackSuccess()</code> in the common_helpers file. The method does
not take any inputs.</dd>
   <dt>notifyDiscord()</dt>
   <dd style="margin: 0 0 1em 0">This method, which should be wrapped with a <code>stage</code> block, notifies via Discord that the
job has ended. This method is usually accompanied with other notifier helpers in the last stage. As of this writing, this method
calls <code>common_helpers.notifyDiscordSuccess()</code> in the common_helpers file. The method does not take any inputs.</dd>
   <dt>startMCS(gInstance, gZone, gServiceAcct, gProject)</dt>
   <dd style="margin: 0 0 1em 0">This method, which should be wrapped with a <code>stage</code> block, is the startup sequence to
start Minecraft. As of this writing, this method runs through various logic to determine if the instance is online or offline, if
the drive is mounted or unmounted, and if the screen (java) is enabled or disabled. The method expects four inputs: <code>gInstance</code>,
<code>gZone</code>, <code>gServiceAcct</code>, and <code>gProject</code>. <code>gInstance</code> is the defined Minecraft instance name
in GCP. <code>gZone</code> is the defined zone where the Minecraft instance lives in GCP. <code>gServiceAcct</code> is the defined
service account which interacts with the Minecraft instance on GCP. <code>gProject</code> is the defined project name for the
Minecraft instance in GCP.</dd>
   <dt>stopMCS(gZone, gProject, gInstance, gServiceAcct)</dt>
   <dd style="margin: 0 0 1em 0">This method, which should be wrapped with a <code>stage</code> block, runs the shutdown sequence
for the Minecraft server. It sends a shutdown warning to players, stops the Minecraft process, and then stops the compute instance
in GCP. The method expects four inputs: <code>gZone</code>, <code>gProject</code>, <code>gInstance</code>, and <code>gServiceAcct</code>.
<code>gZone</code> is the defined zone where the Minecraft instance lives in GCP. <code>gProject</code> is the defined project name
for the Minecraft instance in GCP. <code>gInstance</code> is the defined Minecraft instance name in GCP. <code>gServiceAcct</code>
is the defined service account which interacts with the Minecraft instance on GCP.</dd>
   <dt>verifyMCSOffline(gZone)</dt>
   <dd style="margin: 0 0 1em 0">This method, which should be wrapped with a <code>stage</code> block, verifies that the Minecraft
instance is offline by checking that the compute instance is in a <code>TERMINATED</code> state. If it is not terminated, an
exception is thrown. The method expects one input: <code>gZone</code>, the defined zone where the Minecraft instance lives in GCP.</dd>
   <dt>newWorldOrder(gInstance, gZone, gServiceAcct, gProject)</dt>
   <dd style="margin: 0 0 1em 0">This method, which should be wrapped with a <code>stage</code> block, creates a new Minecraft world
with a generated name. The method expects four inputs: <code>gInstance</code>, <code>gZone</code>, <code>gServiceAcct</code>, and
<code>gProject</code>, matching the parameters used by the Minecraft helpers for world management.</dd>
   <dt>wwwDeployStage(gBucketURL)</dt>
   <dd style="margin: 0 0 1em 0">This method, which should be wrapped with a <code>stage</code> block, deploys web assets to a GCS
bucket using the value provided in <code>gBucketURL</code>. The method expects one input: <code>gBucketURL</code>, the destination
bucket path.</dd>
   <dt>wwwFBDeployStage(fbCredentials)</dt>
   <dd style="margin: 0 0 1em 0">This method, which should be wrapped with a <code>stage</code> block, deploys web assets via Firebase.
The method expects one input: <code>fbCredentials</code>, the credentials identifier to use for the Firebase deployment helper.</dd>
